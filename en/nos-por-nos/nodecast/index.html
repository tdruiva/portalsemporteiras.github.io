  <p>Nodecast is a project of authorial content production of Portal Sem Porteiras. Through the experimentation of the use of audio recording and editing tools we created 6 episodes of a podcast dedicated to dialogue with women in the territory during the pandemic.
We called out to the women with questions and they answered us in audio.
We gathered these answers and turned it into a program, Nodecast, in which the theme of the question launched is connected to a technology theme</p>

<p>The audios we received were so deep and delicate that for us it was something very sacred. For the women, to be able to listen to their answers being played as part of the cast, tied together with the experience of others, was powerful and encouraging.
Initially we wanted this podcast to be something heard only by women, as the circles were also designed to be. Then we realized that a content created was very different than the lived experience of the circles. We have no control over who listens! And since we couldn't really make these podcasts an alternative for our safe spaces, we should take advantage of this potential to make them a space to expand our voices and bring to the public our reflections on issues of the territory.
So, after the first 3 episodes of delicate and personal audio exchanges we inaugurated a second stage.
There would be 3 other episodes with a new format, designed to address our passion for the idea of the community network as a virtual territory.</p>

<p>In a milder phase of the pandemic we were able to interview some women, all of whom had not participated in the circle in the previous year. We asked some questions related to the occupation of the neighborhood and wanted to know how they felt about the space. The answers were real treasures that we received. Those were again tied together with reflections on technology. This has been very important to us, to listen to other women beyond our nearest circle and to expand our network of relationships. Aware of what we represent and how we present ourselves within the territory, we are constantly working to build bridges between the Portal sem Porteiras and the community.</p>

          A quick-rhythmed beat begins to play, and Woman 1 (Ana) begins to speak:<br />
<br />
“Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have been going through a process of searching for independence of buying so many products. So, I started researching to learn how to make my own soap. It worked. Then, I started making my own laundry soap. It worked again. I got excited to make my own sourdough bread starter, which I always thought was too complicated and that I could never do it. But then... I did it! It may seem silly because these are all small things, but they actually have great impact on self-esteem.”<br />
<br />
Her voice fades off, beat keep playing and enters Narrator 1 (Marcela):<br />
<br />
“Coming straight from the Mantiqueira Mountains on the second full moon of Autumn, this is the Nodes thatBond on quaratine! Last semester we were side by side creating new ways to be in the world, and since this year we can’t be phisically together once again, let us then take comfort out of the stories told by within our group.”<br />
<br />
Woman 2 (Keity) enters saying:<br />
<br />
“So, Nodes that Bond asks me what have I been doing to protect myself. I am Keity, I am turning 35 years old in a few days, and I’m here doing quaratine as well. Has it been already fourty days since I’ve been homewith my kids and all that? Well, what I’ve been doing to protect myself... I wake up every morning and makea green juice or a juice with oranges and yams for me and the boys”<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Ju):<br />
<br />
“Yam juice. Everyday... I add all kinds of things, yam, beetroots, pineapple, passionfruit, berries... I make itin the morning and I drink it throughout the day with my son.”<br />
<br />
Woman 2 (Keity):<br />
<br />
“We have been drinking a lot of lime juice, both our lime trees are filled. I have also been hydrating my skin and hair with loads of avocado, eating loads of avocado.... Limes and avocados, avocados and limes...”<br />
<br />
A playful song enters. Woman 4 (Ligia):<br />
<br />
“I’m feeling good, being close to nature like this makes us calm. Being here in this neighborhood, in this place where we are... brings a lot of calm. Breathing well, walking around through the mountains, a bit of meditation, playing songs, creating a lot by myself with my instruments.”<br />
<br />
Woman 5 (Lia):<br />
<br />
“My greatest gift has been going for walks. I wake up really early and go for a walk – the other day I even ran for a bit. And this early morning movement has a refreshing effect on me. It makes me more concentraded, strong. When I come home, things are more fluid, my family at home can feel that I am more in sync. The women are in the core, at least in my home I notice that I have a central role in the family, and ifI am not strong in my foundations, if I am not firm in what I feel, need, or think, all things at home get out ofpace. So, I need to be firm and strong, flowing, breathing, and well. So, all the rest becomes easier...”<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Ju):<br />
<br />
“Everyday when I wake up the first thing I do is to thank the sun. I take my first rays of sun, and I thank it, our great grandfather.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Woman 6 (Alê):<br />
<br />
“I firstly do the Sun Salutation with my 6 and 11 year-old kids. This is something we already did before the pandemic times. Besides that, I also do my daily Yoga practice. But now, these practices suddenly have a different taste and feel. They are stronger. They taste like self care... I bring awareness to vibrations of love, of healing, golden and violet colors for the entire planet... I vibrate for a new, renewed planet.”<br />
<br />
Woman 7 (Soraya):<br />
<br />
“Well, when I wake up, I usually enjoy doing some breathing exercises that strengthen my lungs. Some are from Yoga, some are from theater and singing. The best moment of my day is this one: the meditation. It is wonderful to practice pleasures that your conquer little by little. Then, I bathe in clay. Clay is wonderful for detoxifying. Using clay is taking inflammation out of life! (laughs). And I am in touch with my several friends, aho! I am also in touch with healing, reading tarot cards in a long distance way – not online, but through other connections. If I don’t know the person they will send me a photograph. Me and the one who’sconsulting with me, we connect through the astral plane.”<br />
<br />
Woman 8 (Regina):<br />
<br />
“To me, the challenge of protecting myself from my own unbalacing thoughts, is greater than protecting myself from external things: disease, news. These thoughts can take me to an uncomfortable state of fear andanxiety. So what I’ve been doing is enjoying my own company. Bringing myself to my own body, what I cantake to sensing and breathing.”<br />
<br />
Woman 9 (Maiza):<br />
<br />
“Now I only go to the town center wearing a mask, with my hand sanitizer in the pocket. Usually when I go with my partner we take turns and only one of us leaves the car. I haven’t been alowing the kids to leave the house. Aside from that, I have been trying to keep a healthy mind, filtrating the constant news and information, contacting and talking to people a lot, especially when questioning myself where will our lives go...”<br />
<br />
Woman 10 (Jaque):<br />
<br />
“On friday night I got sick. From friday on I was sick for over ten days – I had a fever, feeling some symptoms... I thought it might be coronavirus, but we can’t know, there’s no testing – there wasn’t and until now there still isn’t. Since then, I stayed home with my family – my daughter and my partner – and feeling very lost. In the first few days I couldn’t do anything... after about fourteen days I became more active at home again. We were always trying to renew things, creating and recreating... after I got more active again I liked it, because I felt I was feeling more living in the present. I feel more active. There are days when the sadness comes, there are so many news... the political situation is horrible, or president is a jackass, there aredays when things are horrible, the energy gets really low... there are great days, bad days, lazy days, active days... this also has to do with my menstrual cycles, I know that. I try to enjoy the fertile times when I feel more active for creating... I have been doing artistic crafts, as well as bindge watching series, watching movies, wasting time online... I have no expectations yet on when this quaratine will end, we can’t know, right?”<br />
<br />
Woman 11 (Satu):<br />
<br />
“Being around people makes us feel protected... If I’m surrounded by people who I love and trust, I feel protected. So, in these times when we see less of the ones we love, it affects our sensation of being unprotected... It feels like a cloud of danger over our heads. And we miss people, right? Missing people perhaps makes us more vulnerable? How to find strengh in the feeling of missing someone? How can we find our power not only despite missing people, but in this feeling of missing them? What protects me is my daily life. Right here, right now. Now I am home, I am okay. I don’t know where or how I’ll be tomorrow, me or my loved ones. But I will conect with here and now, which is all I have. Nobody ever had the “tomorrow”... but perhaps the virus draws more attetion to that feeling, which can cause a lot of anguish in us, mere mortals...”<br />
<br />
Woman 12 (Marcela):<br />
<br />
“I try to take care of my time, so it won’t swallow me whole. Allow my body and my feelings to be, create a scheduele with the kids, avoid diving into the texting world, which can be so negative... at the same time that being productive and a role model is always imposed on us – which is a big capitslistic trap – so many distractions on social network, so much media all around take away our own time, and we are convinced thatwe need to be productive with our time, but they also rob us of our time. It’s like a constant feeling of disastisfaction, which is the greatest trap. To me, if you need healing and processing, all you need to do is sleep some more (laughs)! If you need care, you own body can take care of itself. If you fast for a little whileand sleep some more, give your body time and space, you will heal.”<br />
<br />
Narrator 1 (Marcela):<br />
<br />
“But how do the digital technologies of communication and information influence our self care? Our beloveddigital tutor Tânia brings us a bit of her perspective on Fake News during Corona times. When the moon passes by the Scorpio constellation, it is time to, once again, go through everything we have learned... on theinternet.”<br />
<br />
Tânia:<br />
<br />
“Coronavirus has changed all of our relationships with people, online and even with ourselves. It demands from us a big change in our behaviour to prevent sickness... And how can we prevent from so much out there? How can we prevent from the viruses as well as from the information on the virus itself? In a pandemic moment such as this one, there’s so much of this dynamics: “someone who told someone else who told me”... and social media is constantly in our hands, right? We go to sleep and we wake up and the thing isright here with us. How can we prevent and “desinfect away” misinformation? How do we prepare ourselvesto not follow any random recipe against coronavirus? “Eating a cup of red beans every day is medicine against coronavirus”... who studied that scientifically, how is that a fact? Still, it can be an information that is sent away in phones! Someone receives information from sombedoy they trust, and send it to someone else. That is so common among human beings, because we are willing to protect those who are near us. Also,when we learn something new, we feel like telling more people...<br />
<br />
So what are fake news? Basically, they are misinformation. They are basically lies, and a lot of people believe them. People are once again believing that the earth is flat, and that vaccination is bad for us. A lot of fake news are actually someone’s opinions, which arrive on our medias as actual facts. How do we find out what is fake? You must look for reliable resources, always search for the same information in more places. Search for the news on Duck Duck Go!<br />
<br />
So, should I open every link I receive? Should I share every link I receive? Should I share news if I didn’t even read the entire website? Where did the news come from? And it’s not enough that the news came from acertain study... we should search for studies from reliable institutions. Pay attention to the news you receive, and pay attetion to the news you share. That piece of information can also be harmful for you in two more ways: it can cause you paranoia and anguish – and that why we need to develop a filter in our minds to understand how to actually be careful and safe. Also, fake news can also open space for internet crimes, sincethey are usually about something that triggers fear or anxiety. For instance, you receive a message from someone saying they are from the local health care system, and that they are collecting the phone number of everyone in the neighborhood so it is easier to contact everyone, so they will send a pass code to you and so on... that could be someone trying to kidnap your whats app account, for instance. What are they doing with you account? Probably not sending happy birthday to your friends...<br />
<br />
Narrator 2 (Luísa):<br />
<br />
The dream of a connected world, where we share horizontally our experiences and feel less lonely evolved tosomething we couldn’t have seen coming. Every time you like something, every time you use your credit card, everytime you use ythe phone’s GPS, a digital trail is left behind you. This trail is a result of your online activities, and it is unique. This trail generates a constant flow of information, which is made only for you, and seen only by you. It is your world, custom-made. Try and notice the Youtube suggestions for you. Are they diverse? Do they present a broad range of points of view? Usually not. They follow a certain line ofworld-view, changing only its packaging. This happens because your digital trail creates a very well built profile of you, it is what keeps you comfortable while navigating in the network. Not only does it offer you the exact kind of products you want, but it also shows you a social reality that operates according to your beliefs, and ir even presents news and opinions that are actually very convenient. That is dangerous. It generates a one-sided view of our reality. The algorithms are so powerful they can actually change your real life behaviour, inducing your choices towards someone else’s profit. If we really think about it, it is a real loss in your free-will. Whoever owns our informations, can meticulously manipulate our custom-made universe. And we don’t actually know who owns that information – we don’t read the tiny letters in the apps policy with which we agree when installing the app. We end up accepting that our data is shared with others removing the apps responsability, for instance...<br />
<br />
The flat earth believers that Tânia mentioned is a growing group of people, and the documentary “The earth is flat” approaches this subject very well. On the documentary, we see a large and diverse sample of people defending the idea that earth is flat, and that all images published by Nasa which show the earth as round would be a conspiracy. The scientists tend to get irritated and ridicule the flat earth believers, and in fact it is quite unbelievable that people would think that. What happens is: these people are building they’re world view based on opinions, not facts. Several people, all together, in one-sided world view groups. If you have alarge community of people telling you that the earth is flat, perhaps it will sound more believable. What if your Youtube channel shows you thousands of videos with people defending this idea, and doing experiments to prove it? Even if the experiments are not truthful and scientific, all this information does not sound so fake anymore when everything inside your custom-made world echoes that.<br />
<br />
In fact, how did we all establish our own truths and beliefs, if not refering to things that were taught to us as facts? This is why the scientific method and methods for news and data checking are vital to our health as a community. They work as a pact that we all made together, and that we need to keep. It is a collective responsability.<br />
<br />
The flat earth believers from the documentary let us know that they are constantly being called crazy, and that they have lost friends and family for entering this rabbit hole of beliefs. When we confront them from high heels, the reaction usually reminds us of a battle, where sides attack one another. When things get to that point, facts and opinions no longer differ between each other, and nobody wins.<br />
<br />
Does this sound like a family lunch in 2018 Brazil? Yes, and that is no accident. Who here doesn’t have a beloved family member that voted on someone you despise? Is this person a complete idiot? Is it that simple? What made this person vote in such a way? In the US Elections in 2016, Cambridge Analytica bought the information inside apps like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Whats app and so on. They did that so they could get extremely detailed profiles on American voters. If you were an American citizen, they could tell whats scares you, what calls your attetion, and what would make you change your mind. Global politics is built on war strategies – and dividing to conquer is one of them. Taking care of your data, checkingfacts, paying attention to your clicks and shares are big tasks to all of us in today’s world. With a new wolrd, come new responsibilities.<br />
<br />
A song plays. Tânia speaks:<br />
<br />
During these coronavirus times, we have to keep our eyes opened, be aware, be present in our bodies, moments, our lives. The same should happen with our data, our digital life. Be present. Don’t be clicking on your phone while talking to someone, don’t click on whatever shows up on your whats app... How can we live our lives with one action after the other, instead of doing five things at the same time? Living five lives all at once is very tiring and you end up not living any of them fully. Thats it, guys. Kisses, love you all!<br />
<br />
A song plays:<br />
<br />
“To be present and aware,<br />
Of myself and my body.<br />
Equilibrium takes care of us,<br />
And the care is made from nodes that bond.<br />
<br />
I’m dressed up in talismans.<br />
It all belongs to the invisible plain,<br />
The women from my family protect me.<br />
<br />
Our instincts guide us,<br />
Something like a rage,<br />
I am myself the fire of protection.<br />
<br />
The danger in danger<br />
Is to not let love in,<br />
A bubble where nothing penetrates.<br />
<br />
Our instincts guide us,<br />
Something like a rage,<br />
I am myself the fire of protection.<br />
<br />
On the journey side by side with women,<br />
I protect myself when I’m connected<br />
Being all that I am.<br />
On the journey side by side with women,<br />
towards love.<br />
<br />
On the journey side by side with women,<br />
I protect myself when I’m connected<br />
Being all that I am.<br />
On the journey side by side with women,<br />
towards love.<br />
<br />
Narrator 2 (Luísa):<br />
<br />
You have just heard the Nodes that Bond theme song, composed by the group in one of our project meetings,and now beautifully arranged and recorded by Lia Aroeira and Ligia Kamada.<br />
<br />
Narrator 1 (Marcela):<br />
<br />
We will keep on recording our conversations and sharing with you all. For our next meeting, we would like to hear from you: “Who did I touch that I shouldn’t have? Exception cases during isolation times.” Send us an audio! If you want to send an anonymous story, you can send us in writting and another women can record it. We’ll be waiting for your story until the New Moon...<br />

          A song plays, birds sing, Woman 1 (Lu Pêra) starts speaking:<br />
<br />
“Who did I touch and shouldn’t have? Well, I am a Doula, and I went to São Francisco Xavier (the town nextto ours) to assist on a childbirth. I already knew that this would happen in the middle of this pandemics scenario, social distancing times, trying to imagine how this would happen. How to do this work as a Doula, which has a lot to do with our bodies, and there’s a lot of touching, there’s a lot of actual physical support. What protocols to follow, right? Anyway... I went there, with my humble little face mask, the oils, the resources we have as Doulas. And the birth happened, I had a lot of physical contact with the mother, massaging, physical support, keeping the hands clean at all times, spending the entire time wearing my mask... but, yeah, I did touch the mother, loads. With the godesses surrounding us, guidind the situation, there wasn’t much else I could do but to be there, supporting that mother during childbirth.<br />
<br />
It turned out that the mother had to be transfered to the hospital, and I stayed at their home by myself and slept on the couch. The couple went to the hospital, and they have another son, a small child, who had gone to the neighboorh’s house. When it was sun rise, the little boy enters his home, hoping to find his mom, dad and new little brother were there. And the little boy came in, sat down in the couch, crawled into my lap and gave me hugs and kisses (laughs)! I had no mask on, I was waking up there and this loving little kid just woke me up with hugs and kisses... I didn’t even have a choice, he was on my lap! It is crazy to think that we might have the virus, and that other people might have it, and that such contact could be contagious to other people...<br />
<br />
”A violin song plays, woman 2 (Cacá) starts to speak:<br />
<br />
“Yes, I gave a ride. I gave a ride to two different people during these past 60 days of isolation. One of them was an old lady who works in a place in SP50 (the main road, outside of the neighborhood), who needs public transportation, and the public transportation is operating in a much smaller scheduele. The other day, Iwas returning home and I saw her from my car, going up our road in the neighborhood, under such a strong and hot sun, and I was taken by this anguish and a lot of doubts: should I offer her a ride? And so, I asked her.<br />
<br />
Obviously, she accepted it. And we get apprehensive, right? Especially with other people’s safety. I’m not sure if I have the virus or something, right? Who can guarantee anything?<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Paulinha):<br />
<br />
“Nobody really knows what we can and can’t do... I was at the girls’ home, and taking all the measures to keep a distance, right? I was on the porch, and they were inside, I wasn’t touching anything, all of that. And then Ava (the dog) was right on the street and cut her paw. It was bleeding, and she was crying... at that exact moment, the three of us ran to help her, and suddenly we were so close, and I yelled ‘Oh my gosh, we are too close!!’, and we had touched each other... There are moments when we completely forget that there even is a pandemic, that coronavirus exists, we forget this whole thing... and I wonder what are the things that make us forget, right?”<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Lia):<br />
<br />
“Once I was touched. I was hiking with a friend, on our way to solve a water harvesting structure, and I accidentally cut my finger. And this friend of mine helped me closing the wound, stopping the bleeding, she hugged me and kissed my forehead. I was still a bit dizzy from the pain, and turned to her and was like ‘hey, you kissed me! Why would you do that?’ (laughs) and she just said ‘Ah, now its done. Oh gosh, what am I gonna do?’ It was stronger than her – she saw me there, bleeding, with a wound... and she acted on solidarity.”<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Paulinha):<br />
<br />
“Also, the other day, when I was really, really sad, and crying, and I thought I was alone, there was nobody in the street and it was very early morning...”<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Lia):<br />
<br />
“And I saw her walking down the street, I could see from a distance that she was crying.”<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Paulinha):“<br />
<br />
But then, a friend of mine arrived, and saw me crying loads.”<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Lia):<br />
<br />
“Last year I went through a similar situation, when I was crying in the middle of the street. And when we cryon the street its because we are really really sad, right?”<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Paulinha):<br />
<br />
“She saw me like that, and her imediate impulse was to touch me!”<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Lia)<br />
<br />
“I got closer to her and I didn’t even think, I completely forgot about pandemics and all that, and just grabbed her and gave her the biggest hug. And it was funny, we both said the same thing...”<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Paulinha):<br />
<br />
“No, you can’t touch me!”<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Lia)<br />
<br />
“But it was bigger than me, it was something I didn’t really think, I just did it, I could see she was going through a painful moment, and I identified with that”<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Paulinha):<br />
<br />
“In these times when we are trying to protect one another, and things happen without us expecting them, and suddenly they take us away from coronavirus and social distancing, and bring us closer... and suddenly the awareness of being in this moment comes back again.”<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Lia):<br />
<br />
“In any other moment I hadn’t given in to touching other people... except in these situations of embracing someone. And that is good – to know that we have this solidarity, bigger than ourselves. Even during pandemic times, it is good to know that this feeling exists in a bigger place.<br />
<br />
”A song plays, Narrator 1 (Marcela) enters:<br />
<br />
“The information we have so far suggests that the main transmission route for Covid-19 are the respiratory droplets. The respiratory droplets are generated when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. Whoever stands near that person, for about a meter or less away, is exposed to infected respiratory droplets. The hard part is to know who is infected, since many times, we may not present any symptoms at all. Also, these droplets can remain on things, on surfaces in general. And if you touch that surface and then touch any mucous membranes in your body without sanitizing your hands, you might catch the virus.<br />
<br />
This is all very new. Everyday, we have more news that make us wonder if we are taking the correct measures according to our context, which can be very diverse: from the risks of contagion to the kinds of possible interactions...<br />
<br />
And Nodes that Bond, always commited to the self care of the extensions of our bodies-machines, wants to know: what about the viruses from our digital devices, what do we know about them? And how can we protect ourselves?<br />
<br />
”A song plays, Tânia (the projects tutor) enters:<br />
<br />
“Virus, Virus, Coronavirus... who here is afraid of viruses? The same way coronavirus can impact our society, a computer virus can do the same to the computer’s life. But the computer’s life can also affect your life... (laughs). Who here never had something very important to do right when the computer suddenly stopped working? ‘Oh, that’s a virus, girl’ - you might hear. How can we tell if a computer has a virus or not?<br />
<br />
The computer is a machine that basically executes commands. These commands are something that someonewrites down. The fact that you can open Facebook on a computer comes from someone saying: ‘you click here, type this, you will then see this screen, with these images...’.  The computer virus is a command through which someone can say ‘Hey, you know all these computer files right there? Send them all to this address here, to me, and without the computer’s owner knowing, ok?’. The computer can’t tell if this command came from you or from someone eles without your permission. The message arrived to it from some digital corner and told it to execute that command.”<br />
<br />
Narrator 1 (Marcela):<br />
<br />
“It is important to remember that who gives the commands to the computer are people. Which means, someone who speaks the language of machines can tell my computer to do something with which I do not agree and that can put me, my data and my machine in danger. But how is that, Tânia? Through which digitaldoors can such conversations happen?”<br />
<br />
Tânia:<br />
<br />
“Emails, links, files that you download can be a way. You open someone’s e-mail, download the file, and turns out it was just a text file, and it seems like its blanck, its nothing... it could be executing actions in yourcomputer. It could also come through a USB that downloads a virus automatically when the USB is plugged into the computer. What the virus will do depends entirely on what are the commands that the person typed in, what they wanted exactly... how can we undersand what’s inside the mind of someone who creates a virus?<br />
<br />
The same way the flu works, this virus can propagate itself in a contagious manner, which could be through the USB, links that you open, attachments in messages, webpages that contain a virus... so we should alwaysbe very much aware about what websites we navigate around... or we receive a link that says “This is a super app that you can download for free right now, usually it is payed for, but hey in this link it is for free, cause we cracked the software!’ People are still not so much aware of how internet works... what is a cracked software? It’s when someone changes the license of the software somehow, the person manages to put a false license... but sometimes the cracked software could have its very code changed, changes in what kinds of things the software will execute in the computer. At the end of the day, the computer only executes commands that someone gave it.<br />
<br />
If someone downloads Photoshop, they go and use the Photoshop software... if it was cracked, it could be something like someone who cracked Photoshop and put a command into it for the computer to share the images that are being manipulated in that machine’s photoshop. So the person who cracked it and sent it around as “Free Photoshop download link” is able to see all the images that are opened and manipulated in computers of those who downladed it... I don’t know why people do that, and the computer doesn’t know if it was you who told it to do something or a virus. The same way I can circulate in places where I can get infected with something contagious, I can also circulate in online spaces where the computer can get infected. If you go and watch a movie with online streaming, and you click “play” a thousand times and nothing happens, or a thousand new windows open... suddenly, the computer is acting strange...”<br />
<br />
Narrator 1 (Marcela):“Wow, this whole thing really makes us feel insecure... Makes me a bit nervous! Is there a way out of all this?”<br />
<br />
Tânia:<br />
<br />
“Should I install an anti-virus software? Do anti-virus software work? Personally, I’m not a big fan of anti-viruses because they are softwares made by companies that can screen and see everything the is inside your computer, and can send to other companies information that they could say is “suspicious”... And I don’t want my information going around without me knowing about it! (laughs) And so I use the Linux System, where there are a lot less viruses... What about Windows System, should you use anti-virus? Well, It might eventually remove something, but the ideal thing to do is format the computer, and if you use the “Windows Defender”, it does the same job an antivirus does.”<br />
<br />
Narrator 1 (Marcela):<br />
<br />
“I would like to insert a comment here to mention Linux. Linux is an Operational system just like Windows, Android, Mac... but the big difference is that Linux is free and open-source. What does that mean? It means that its code is available for anyone to use it, study it, modify it and distribute it freely. It is opened and for free. Which means that it does not create a dependancy and power like Softwares that have owners. They also have a very friendly interface, just like any other Operational System. And because there are so many people using Linux, there is a massive online community always willing to help solving the doubts and issues that might come up in the internet forums – from the simplest commands to complicated problems.”<br />
<br />
Tânia:<br />
<br />
“A lot of times the people who develop computer viruses are trying to reach the highest amount of people possible. Not aiming at one specific target, but aiming everywhere, all around. And when doing that, if the vast majority of computers in the world are Windows and I’m aiming at everything all around, it is easier for the person to “infect” a Windows computer simply because there are more people using it. In Linux’s case, besides the fact that there are less people using it, there’s also the fact that the way Linux deals with the commands and executions inside the computer is different. But that does not mean that there are no viruses for Linux!<br />
<br />
An effective way of not getting infected is to go to an island (laughs)! All by yourself! [fun music playing]<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, being connected is to assume some risks... but being connected is also assuming that you can protect others! When you are connected with someone, you are willing to share things with them, sharing insecurities, knowledge and also risk of infection (laughs)! Is it worth it being shut inside an hermetically sealed glass box in order to be safe? Yes, no? I don’t know...<br />
<br />
I hope you don’t catch corona or any other virus, but if you catch it, we’ll fix it! That’s life, right? Kisses, miss all of you guys!”<br />
<br />
Narrator 1 (Marcela):<br />
<br />
“This was another episode of the Nodes that Bond podcast. A channel that me and Bagope [Luísa] chose to keep on meeting you guys to discuss some of the big themes on our daily life thay may seem for far away from us: the digital self care.<br />
<br />
It is hard to replace our loving and rich meetings, but we hope to somehow still be opening windows to the ways in which we exist in the online world, and warming your hearts during this cold pandemic. For our next meeting, we would like to know from you: What have you been dreaming with during this pandemic? Also, expanding our dialogs, we will have a new series within this podcast: “Girl, get it off your chest!” - with the mic opened for you to say whatever you want to.<br />

          A smooth song plays. A woman’s voice (Adelita) enters:<br />
<br />
“To share dreams.... What kind of world do we visit when our eyes are closed? Yesterday I dreamt of tigers. They were wondering around the street, I could see them through the window of my mother’s house. They were chilling by the sidewalk. First, I saw a female lion. Then, I saw a tiger. I felt complete fear and helplessness before the strenght and sovereignty of those animals so close to me. Fascination and fright in the same proportion. They would enter my home... I tried to close all doors with my keyes, but that was in vain. In three pulses they would slam the doors opened. They were not exactly agressive, but absolutely powerful. They did not fear me, and came really close. There was not exactly an attack... but I felt it was just a matter of time before that happened... until their hunger came. Then, I woke up.”<br />
<br />
Woman 1 (Sylvia Baptista):<br />
<br />
“I would begin this by asking all of you to imagine a very sunny day, in an opened and wide kind ofplace, a bright day. Later, when the sun goes down, the night comes, and there are no electric lights nearby. And suddenly we can see the sky completely filled with stars. When thinking about dreams, I like to bring this image, because all those stars were already there, but we could not see them, it was a sunny day... The daylight outshines the light of those stars. It is something like that, what happens with dreams. Our consciousness is like this bright, sunny day, filled with light. We are always with those lights on, which does not allow us to see the light of the stars that are right there. But when we go to sleep, we turn off those lights of awareness and enter another state – we dive into the unconscious mind. And out uncouncious mind is this great mistery, which gives us this gift every single night – our dreams.”<br />
<br />
Woman 2 (Carol Coelho):<br />
<br />
“During the night I always feel very cold. My feet get very cold... and I dreamt I was going to buy ablanket. When I arrived at the store, there were police officers there. But I didn’t find that strange, clearly I had the feeling that it was the middle of the covid pandemics and I should not be on the street, that I had to buy my blanket and run away from there. When I entered the store, I found my grandma’s sister [laughs], Auntie Ivone. She came to me and she hugged me, kissed me all over my face, squeezed my cheeks, and said “Carol, I missed you so much, you look so beautiful!”, and she would not stop kissing me... and that made me so embarassed, I kept thinking “My God, she doesn’tknow about social distancing! She doesn’t know we shouldn’t be kissing people, hugging people... how am I gonna tell her?” And she wouldn’t stop kissing me all over, and I just wanted to run away from there, I didn’t know what to do and felt completely helpless...”<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Ana):<br />
<br />
“I had an interesting dream about two weeks ago. I was very concerned that the City Hall’s projects would be cancelled and I woulnd’t have any source of income, and I was already planning some kind of Plan B for my life. That was a sunday. I would wait just one more week to see if the City Hall would call me about the projects, and I was waiting on that. And then, on sunday, I told my sonabout this plan B. Right on monday, I had this very interesting dream. I dreamt I was at the City Hall, going to check if they would call me or not. I was at the patio, and I saw this room, and there was someone eles sitting on my chair, working. I was a bit hurt, knowing that someone replaced me... I felt that, but didn’t say anything. I took another look at the person and it was Beth, from Beira do Riacho [a restaurant in the neighborhood]. I left there a bit sad, but also accepting the situation. On monday 8 am, I got a call from the City Hall asking me to go there and sign the contract, I would go back to the project. So, I tought that was a very interesting dream, almost anomen...”<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Luisa Luna):<br />
<br />
“The sea has been very present in my dreams... so, so much. All kinds of dreams – the last one was so scary, there was a giant squeed that wanted to steal Davi [her baby], but I don’t remember details... the dream I would like to tell is about a house. I have dreamt about this house before, it is always changing bit by bit. Before, when I dreamt about it, I could not live in this house, it belonged to somebody else, or was rented, a bit to do with our dramas in this neighborhood [laughs]. But, is was almost becoming my house, I was going to live in it. But this last time, to get to the house, you had to take a boat, and navigate in this beautiful and enormous sea. The house wasalso huge, beautiful.<br />
<br />
But, when I got there, my intention was not to occupy the whole house – I was just going to occupy one bedroom. A small, tiny bedroom by the living room on the first floor. And I remember thinking to myself “Nah, this is good, I can live just here, here I can do everything Ineed, have my little kitchen, my bedroom, my home... this is good, I don’t need all that space...”. But then, I suddenly realized that the walls in this bedroom were made of glass, and so it seemed like I was by myself... but these walls did not face the sea. They faced a huge street market [laughs], where there was loads and loads of people passing by and seeing me through the walls... and I thought “Wow, but what is the meaning of all this??”... And in the dream, the solution was simply to put some curtains up...”<br />
<br />
Woman 5 (Fernanda):“<br />
<br />
I dreamt that I was here, in the neighbourhood, and there were some kids going around without much supervision and they were close to accessing some weapons, some dangerous things, and those kids ended up running away. And I went after them, and when I was on my way I ran into this woman who had a magic mirror, something like that. When I looked at my reflexion, I saw myself extremely different from what I appeared to be. I had morbid obesity, and I had a huge lump on my neck, wich was a tumor. And I remember I asked to speak to this woman, who was some kind of a doctor, and I said: ‘Do whatever you need, please take this out’. And she said: ‘this is not quite how this works’.”<br />
<br />
Woman 6 (Gabi Delias):<br />
<br />
“I’m going to tell about a flashback I had this week about an experience – it was a dream, but I call it an experience, because it was so intense. It happened when I was in the ICU, a very difficult time in my life. It lasted a week, everyday the same dream: a research kind of environment, an older woman who looked like Mariana Muniz [brazilian actress] and the other researchers were younger,and they all did experiments with women, and they did a fertilization work: they would cross-over genes of female women with Jatobá trees [a species of beautiful and large brazilian trees]. It was socrazy. And I was submitted to this experiment. In the dream, I was in this research place, lying in bed, completly still, and they would take blood samples and inject things on me a lot of times throughout the day. And this place was by a lake, and it was Axel’s house [Axel is a member of our community in the neighborhood]! Crazy, right? And I would ask – ‘what are you doing to me?’ Because I’m not a young woman anymore, I am almost 50 years old! And they would tell me that I was a powerful matriarc, a great genitor, and that they were investing in me... And that was the crazy experiment of those people, who were beings filled with light, and they were creating a being that was half human being and half Jatobá tree.... And that was the dream.”<br />
<br />
Woman 7 (Adelita):<br />
<br />
“I dreamt about a female buffalo. I was walking down the street with Amora, my daughter. It was anempty street, made out of rocks. It was very early morning, and the fear was in the air: somehow, allthese things we are going through were present in this dream. And so a gate to a house opened up, and a mighty female buffalo came out of there. She sat in the middle of street, much like a queen, asif nothing else was happening. Then, a woman dressed in red came out of the house, long hair, and went towards the female buffalo. And the buffalo would keep pulling the ears of the woman, as if it was telling her secrets. I realized the female buffalo and the woman were sisters. And on the other side of the street, me and Amora would just watch the scene, and we couldn’t believe it! Afterwards,we left.”<br />
<br />
Woman 8 (Jade):<br />
<br />
“We were in the back of the first house we lived in this neighborhood. In this case, the upstairs neighboor. I went to the back, and I remember seeing a dog and thinking “hm, I don’t know this dog”. When I was coming back, I was walking and the floor was all muddy. And then I looked at the gate and there started to pop up lots and lots of dogs, and I was like “fuck, I’m done, I’m going to die”. I was already thanking life and saying goodbye, and one of the dogs was already coming towards me. He bit my leg and I was like “Hey, cutsie, get out of here”... and then the others came as well, and that was my fear. When they came, the one that was biting me put me up on his back and then started rolling over the backs of each dog. They were forming a spiral shape, and while they did that, they would roll me over each of their backs, and the first dog that I was on was the center of the spiral.... And I would roll over each of their backs, and it was so soft andtender... [laughs] and when the spiral was over – it was a looot of dogs – I was home!”<br />

“Welcome to our dreams. In this podcast we have two special guests. They are both psychologists, and are here to tell us a bit about the dreams within their lines of study. Sylvia Baptista is a Jungian psychotherapist, and she is also the mother of Paula and Luísa – the one on the Nodes that Bond team. And Juliane do Prado is a psychotherapist that works for the public health system here in our town, Monteiro Lobato, where she follows the line of Psychoanalisis-oriented brief psychoterapy.”<br />
<br />
Juliane do Prado (Psychoanalisis-oriented brief psychoterapist)<br />
<br />
“Freud says that dreams are made of uncounsicous desires, meaningful memories of the daily life, memories of the past, feelings that we might have during the night... but, the most interesting part for him, is to use this material, which is like a patchwork quilt, to understand what was repressed. The job of the psychotherapy would be to broaden our consicnousness so that people can make more assertive choices, or else we keep repeating uncouncious dinamycs.”<br />
<br />
Sylvia Baptista (Jungian psychoterapist)<br />
<br />
“We understand dreams as something very enigmatic. They are filled with symbols – the word “symbol” means something that unites different meanings, it is opposed to the word “diábolo” which has to do with separation. So, the symbols bring in this idea of uniting two meanings, and Jung used to say that they are the best way to describe something that you can’t quite explain. So, the symbol is infinite – it always has another face of what it represents to show us. And so, dreams are filled with symbols, and we are constantly trying to understand, to give it some kind of a shape. And the one that does that is our minds, which separates things. I actually have here a quote from Jung: “The dream is the small and hidden door in the most intimate place of the psyche. All awareness of the self is isolated, knows isolated things, as it separates, understands and onlysees that which can be referred to this self. The awareness of the self consists on limitations, even if it reaches the most far away constelations. All that is counciousness, separates. But in dreams, we enter the most deep, general, truthful and eternal of a person, who is still in the dusk of the night, only beginning, when they were the whole, and the whole was them. When the self would identify with the simplest nature. That is why it doen’t come as a surprise that in all ancient cultures, the most impressive dreams were considered a message from the Gods.”<br />
<br />
Woman 9 (Ana Paula):<br />
<br />
“I hardly ever have dreams, it’s rare for me. But, curiously, last week, for two nights, I had really bad dreams. On the first night I dreamt I was in the balcony of an apartment, lying on the hammock,and I saw someone falling off the building right in front of mine. It was a suicide. On the second night, I don’t remember much, I just remember my wrists opening up, and a lot of blood pouring out of them... and then I woke up.<br />
<br />
And this made me think that we live in a privileged town, a lot of farms, opened spaces, houses... but in big cities, where people live in buildings, a lot of people live by themselves - how are these people doing in this moment of isolation? I know that technology helps, you can binge watch series... but that’s not everything, right?”<br />
<br />
Juliane do Prado<br />
<br />
“When we talk about subjectivity, what do we mean by that? It is all those things that I am made of as a person. All the things that go on within me. All my features, sensory capacities, emotional, affective, imaginary and rational capacities. They are all built in exchanges, we call it dialectics, as it is a two way street between myself and my surroundings – society, culture, politics... and this two way exchanges are mediated by communication. The dialectics is mediated by communication. Andhere we can discuss the technologis of information exchanges and dialectics. We might remember of the Greek myth of Prometheus, God of Fire. He got into a fight with Zeus, because of Zeus’ omnipotence, and he left the Fire as a human’s responsability. So that he could guarantee the knowledge to humanity – the power over matter and the technical knowledge. And this relationship between technology and the study of the techniques, is really connected to the development of humanity.<br />
<br />
The “power” over natural resources, the wars, energy production, industrial revolution, capitalism...with all this impact of technological development, a certain strangeness comes up – in work relationships, in the means of production, in social relationships... and of men and women with themselves. Today, I see in my clinic a significant increase in depression, anxiety syndromes, panic syndrome, increase in suicides... So it all has a great impact in people’s mental health, and there is also the alienation people are in... and we can’t tell the impact of all this for the next generations, who are already born with a cellphone in their hands, and have so much ease to use those tools for communication and have those connections as a means of identity construction for themselves. And we shouldn’t really reflect on that with moral judgments like “is this good, is this bad...?” It is an odd and uncertain situation, which we will try to manage just like other processes of crisis and transformation. We will be at least a bit able to manage that, find resources and tools to deal with the matters that come up from all this. But what I find interesting is for us to have the leading role inall this, in society, culture, politics.... And reflect on where we are, and which society do we want to have, what kind of health do we want to have, understand the importance of the connection betweenpeople and the connection with ourselves, with what is sacred. I don’t believe we can replace the human connection with the digital connection.”<br />

“Night breaks, the light comes up within my unconsciousness. Tonight, the dreams are the big stars.May the symbols come and tell me stories. I wake up and I’m connected. My machine that still dreams in algorithims and whispers through my gaze the forged nature of the deep self. Who is playing God behind the algorithims and competing with me, side by side, for the domains of my unconsciousness? Tânia, tell us a bit about the artificial intelligence behind our favorite contents?”<br />
<br />
Our tutor, Tânia<br />
<br />
“The other day I asked to borrow my friend’s phone to listen to a song. He denied [laughs] and said ‘No, Tânia, you will ruin my algorithims!’. - Ruin what?! Your algorithims? What is that? Well, basically, algorithim, in computer science, is a recipe to execute something. This something could be resolving a math problem, or showing on the screen the picture of a cat, or to show the best recommendation for a video. Algorithims work like a recipe for baking a bread. There are the ingredientes, the instructions, the time needed for baking... and if it all works, you have a bread by the end of it. Youtube’s algorithim, for instance.<br />
Say you just watched a video by Perota Chingo [an argentinian band], what will be the next video the website will show you? Will it be Cazuza, Elba Ramalho, Chitãozinho e Xororó [a broad range ofbrazilian artists]? If you are only listening to songs by latin american women, it is very unlikely to come up a video by a north american man. Youtube ends up following a sequence of similarity among the videos, to encourage you to stay longer and longer and longer in their platform. The platform’s interest is that you don’t leave it. There is a whole marketing area called “attention marketing”, in which the platforms develop algorithms to get and keep our attention.In the case of youtube, that would mean playing an endless cyle of videos most similar to each another, always towards a more exteme side of the theme of the videos.<br />
<br />
If you start watching videos about politics, on consevative politics, for instance, the platform will show you more and more extreme videos on conservative youtube channels. Human beings have a tendency to go deeper and deeper into issues, and the algorithims are filled with psychology knowledge within them, it is not simply math, numbers... there are human behaviour analysis. Why does Netflix always goes straight to the next episode, instead of asking if you actually want to see the next episode? It is simply consuming you in the attention marketing logic, getting you to stay in that platform, consuming their contents, without leaving the infinite looping. When we talk about music – a lot of people like Spotify. Spotify has, in a way, good recommendations foryou because it captures the type of sound waves of the music you listen to, and the next recommendation won’t necessarily be from the same band or gender. The platform manages to find songs that has a sound, a rythim, a beat, something that relates to the song before... and you stay there, in an infinite looping of similar songs. And what is the issue when we receive a lot of content that is similar to one another, and having some kind of tendecy towards something? You basically stay trapped inside a bubble. It’s like being inside a catholic church and wanting to listen about atheism. You will only listen to one version, have acess to one kind of content, and will not be able to compare the different types of content – they will not appear to you.<br />
<br />
The algorithims create bubbles and bubbles that narrow down more and more information that circulates and appears to you. Futhermore, the fact that the algorithim is made to addict us and keep us connected shows us the algorithim could also be doing something for someone’s interest on something. If the owner of the platform has some kind of a political view, and they want a specific content to spread among specific users... Lets say – me, Tânia, I have a profile as an online user. I have my taste in music, my political views... sometimes even my way to dress and style they could trace. Which is all different from Lu, for instance, who has a different profile. Each one of us listens to things differently, we have different views and arguments. And sometimes something fits better my profile than hers. So, if for some reason I am reading some news on a website, and this website is able to see what kind of profile I have, the recomendation for the next news I might read could be much more assertive, and I will keep on navigating through that website, and if the website can study a bitdeeper my profile, and they have a political view they want to spread, not only could that website indicate me content that is connected to my ideology, but also connected with the message thewebsite wants to spread. Who creates those algorithims and why are they made to be this way?<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, it is all related to power and money. Power brings money, money brings power... it doensn’t matter what comes first, what matters is that your attention is in that game, and it is being consumed. And it is being consumed in such high levels that we stay online, on average, about 8 hours a day in Brazil. And this constant attention alters the way you organism desires and searches for information. And those algorithims will work on that: which content will you receive, and in what moment will you receive it? And what will this content tell you? And it is up to us: do we really want to receive this amount of content simply being handed out to us so easily? Back at home my family says ‘If the alms are to high, the saints get suspicious.’ If you only watch on TV allthe time the news that São Paulo has robbery, robbery, robbery, and you don’t live in São Paulo, but next week you have to go there... what will you be afraid of? Running into a shark or being robbed?[laughs]<br />
<br />
So there you go... the media usually is able to create the narratives. The difference between the television media and the internet media is that the television media has a reduced profile on theusers. They might go as far as knowing the house of the cities that are on in specific hours... they don’t know who is in front of the TV. Not like the computer or the cellphone. They know whose phone this is. They have a much more refined profile on who is looking at that screen and what message they want to give them. So, are we able to get rid of those algorithims that create those bubbles around us? Of course we can. There is a tool just like Google Chrome, for instance, called Thor. Thor does not save the information of the searches made during navigation... this way, each consult that you make on the internet, is like a whole new person is searching. There are some books and documentaries on this theme, about how we are existing inside those bubbles, and how this interferes on our lives, our daily lives.<br />
<br />
Among them there is one by Frank Castle [an anonymous writer she saw online] in which he talks about the economics of attention. If we are rowing on this boat or if we are beingtaken by the waves... there is also an interview with a brazilian author called Pollyana Ferrari, who is a specialiston digital communication from PUC-SP [a brazilian university]. She wrote a book called “How to leave the bubble” - and the book is about the dissemination of fake news in social networks and how it affects our beliefs. There is also a documentary called “The great hack”, from Netflix. The documentary shows how people’s facebook profiles were used to the spreading of political campaings – both in the UK and USA’s Trump 2016 campaign. This documentary shows how they sent content to those who were indecisve. There is another document on the economics of attention and how it is connected to consumption productivity. How is the high amounts of time being connected affects our consumption habits. And there is another documentary called “Freenet”, this one you can find in free spaces, such as Libreflix – an opened version of Netflix, its a brazilian project. On Libreflix, you can find the Freenet documentary, which discusses how much freedom we really have online, not only to access content, but also to express ourselves, and who governs the internet, who is accessing all the information behind the screen, and how does that work...? [voice fades into music]<br />
<br />
Woman 10 (Lia):<br />
<br />
“These days all I have been dreaming about are crowds. Streets and avenues filled with people, people who I had forgotten about showing up, people I never really knew that much, people I’ve never met, they all show up [laughs]. But simply everyone mixed up, a lot of things happening all the time, so crazy. Just as it really is when you go to a concert or something, things get all mixed up,people going around, we speak loudly, we don’t quite understand what people are saying, someone arrives, someone passes by... and this is what my dreams look like lately.”<br />
<br />
Woman 11 (Ana):<br />
<br />
“I had a dream the other day. With this whole thing with not opening the Charity Bazaar [which sheorganizes and runs twice a year with clothes and toys from everyone in the neighborhood], it wouldbe around this time of year, and people keep asking me “Ana, how about the Bazaar, how about it?”- and I don’t know if we will have it this year. For some people I organize some things, people pass by asking for pants, or shirts for working outside, and then I go and search for them if something comes up. And so the other day I dreamt I was there, separating all these clothes, to loads of different people. And it was funny, Amelinha and Ney [people from the neighborhood] had asked me that same week to keep pants and shirts that came up for them. And in the dream, I was separating clothes for people to go to work. And I dreamt about it, because I was thinking about it – about not opening the bazar this year, having people asking me, what I was going to do...”<br />
<br />
Woman 12 (Angélica):<br />
<br />
“Everyday I wake up saying that I dreamt about something. But few of those stay kept in my memory. I dream a lot about Pandavas [our local school], because I was there for so long, a lot of my dreams happen there. But one dream I had recently was such a good one. I dreamt about a childhood friend with whom I don’t have much contact anymore, but she is still very dear to me. So, I dreamt of her, we were in a tree house, and I was trying to go down, and I got stuck on the stairs. And she started laughing so hard, and she would laugh, and I would laugh... and when I wokeup I realized that the laughs were exactly, exactly the same as our childhoods, from when we laughed so much and played so much, you know? And it was such a good dream, I woke up so happy...”<br />
<br />
Narrator - Marcela<br />
<br />
“It so good to us, Angelica, to know about this laugh that lives within you, who, not by chance, takes care and understands our children [Angelica is the local kindergarden teacher]. Ana, thank you for taking care of these wonderful exchanges. We are patiently waiting for you Bazaar... outside. All the dreams descibed in this podcast are from women who live in Monteiro Lobato. We are very grateful to each one for sharing them. Nodes that Bond is a project of the Portal sem Porteiras Association that brings reflections about connectivity among women.Thank you for listening to our dreams.”<br />

          A song plays and the Narrator, Luisa, starts to speak:<br />
<br />
“Welcome to another Nodes that Bond podcast. This is a trilogy in which we will tell you about the community internet network here in the neighborhood, the Portal sem Porteiras (Gateless gateway) or PSP.<br />
<br />
In this first episode we'll talk about the occupation of space, whether physical or virtual, because despite being a very recent invention, the Internet follows the old structuring forms of capitalism, in which everything has a price and an owner, and to move around, we need permission.<br />
<br />
To begin with, let's listen to the voices of women here in the Souzas neighborhood, interviewed by Simone Cavassi. They kindly donated a little of their time so that we can better understand the transformations of the territory from the point of view of those who lived and live here.<br />
<br />
Woman 1 (Ana):<br />
<br />
"To grow up in this neighborhood, to me, was wonderful. I could play on the streets, with my friends... so much that I grew up, had my kids, and decided to live here, only so they could also enjoy all this.<br />
<br />
Simone, interviewer, asks:<br />
<br />
"What was your favorite place when you were a kid?"<br />
<br />
Woman 2 (Ana Serrinha):<br />
<br />
"In the country, with my mother. Helping my mother to work, plant beans, plant corn".<br />
<br />
Simone<br />
<br />
"Were you playing?"<br />
<br />
Woman 2 (Ana Serrinha):<br />
<br />
"No, my mother wouldn't let usplay, it was all time on the hoe working."<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Cida):<br />
<br />
"Well, I grew up in this neighborhood until I was twelve. I played a lot, a lot of kids, my cousins, climbed trees, fell from guava trees, enjoyed a lot. Then at twelve I had to leave unfortunately to São José [the nearest big city] to work. My mother had her life, and I did not want to interfere and so I left home. I went to work in a family house and came back only after I was already 18. Then I was already a teenager, mature, old and all, right?"<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Katia):<br />
<br />
"Growing up in this neighborhood was incredible for me, it was a wonderful experience. I'm the daughter of a huge family, I'm an adopted daughter, I've had many siblings, twenty brothers and sisters. Growing up in a wonderful place like this, where you can play, there's not a worry about schedules, or problems that today would make me not let my kids play like I used to. But it was very good, to play and grow up here".<br />
<br />
Woman 2 (Ana Serrinha):<br />
<br />
"I like to take care of my plants! My little plants, cabbage... my backyard!"<br />
<br />
Woman 5 (Mukta):<br />
<br />
"My favorite place here in the neighborhood is my land, in my house. The house isn't ready yet, so it's not ideal, but the land is incredible. It's near the square, you can see the square from here, but it's high, facing the mountain, and there's toucans and little birds, the sunset is beautiful and there's sun all day long... It's not such a big piece of land, but it's our size".<br />
<br />
Woman 1 (Ana):<br />
<br />
"I lived in several places, more into the woods, without energy, which was very precarious, off the road with difficult access ... Then, when I got married, I moved to my house, near the soccer field, on the corner that goes up there to Aconchego Inn, I lived there for nine years, and then moved to the house that is where the Luisas live today, and lived there for another seven years. So only there, on that street, I lived sixteen years".<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Katia):<br />
<br />
"My favorite place when I was a kid was a little waterfall there is in Pandavas. Who lives here in the region knows what Pandavas is [the neighborhood school situated in a beautiful forest area]. It was such a nice place! I liked to steal carambola from my neighbor, to ride horses [laughs]...”<br />
<br />
Narrator -Luisa<br />
<br />
“While we were doing this podcast, we started to question ourselves about the enclosure of the common fields, and how this happened (and still happens) in Brazil. For this reflection, it is impossible not to remember the indigenous peoples who occupied thisterritory before the arrival of the Portuguese, who in turn violently imposed the practice of dividing and sharing the land, putting up fences and walls, and listing their owners. Land divided first into hereditary captaincies and then into merchandise.<br />
<br />
So we decided to call a friend who has been with the indigenous people for a long time and who, learning from this conviviality, accepted to help us translate this other conception of territory that has a lot to teach us. It is Marina Villarinho who talks to you now.<br />
<br />
Marina Villarinho<br />
<br />
“Indigenous people for a long time and who, learning from this conviviality, accepted to help us translate this other conception of territory that has a lot to teach us. It is Marina Villarinho who talks to you now. Marina Villarinho “Indigenous peoples, or rather, native peoples, hundreds of years, ago lived on a huge land, without fences or gates, walking all over the place, without the slightest idea that there could be property on the land. For the indigenous people, what bound them to that land was the care that they and their ancestors, for many and many generations, dedicated to the places they frequented;<br />
<br />
It happened that one day these people were surprised by a people who had a very different understanding of how to live and care for a place. They had long been accustomed to walls and fences that determined that a piece of land was someone's possession.<br />
<br />
And if it was 500 years ago that this meeting took place, these two points of view still exist today. To better explain these two points of view, I wanted to try an exercise of fabulation here:<br />
<br />
I ask you to imagine one of those science fiction movies where the Earth is invaded by a race of aliens. Well, in this film these aliens pass as humans todominate the earth precisely because the resources of their planet of origin have already been exhausted.<br />
<br />
Imagine that this dominated planet, or the new world, became known by the invaders by the name of: Brazil. It's obvious then who the aliens are in this story; I don't think we need spoilers. But the indigenous peoples, those who inhabited this planet, they were many... And among them, some were allies, others were enemies, each one with their language, their customs and beliefs, or their way of living. And without even imagining that there could be such a different way to live on earth, the indigenous peoples for a long time experienced ways of living that were quite nomadic, stopping here and there, where the relationships flourished, or where the places mixed with their experiences.<br />
<br />
In this film of ours, when the invasion happened, the aliens were crazy about gold and precious stones. But coming here they found much more! They found a plentiful and abundant land, sheltered by the indigenous people who were here. No wonder, the aliens called this invasion a discovery, and without authorization, they began to take these resources as their own. They often destroyed what they found to, among other things, plant sugar cane to feed those who remained in their old world of origin.<br />
<br />
Now... imagine you that this story is based on real facts. The indigenous people and their lands were invaded by an alien race disguised as white humans -who forever became known as Europeans. Worse! At this point in the film, andwith a certain wrapping in our stomachsm we realize that the European aliens won: they came to stay, imposing on everyone, human and non-human, their way of life, which is also a way of killing.<br />
<br />
Back to our film, the Europeans who arrived in spaceships disguised as caravels, became fenced in the fields that were previously accessed by everyone here. Besides, they started to call whatever was inside their fence, their property. Clever, the European aliens, knew how to blend in: they married the some of theindigenous people and also enslaved them, passing on this predatory form of life.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, we even ask ourselves: are we them?<br />
<br />
The invaders called their heirs Brazilians, who in turn continued to invent, since 1500, new fences. Fences are sometimes made of barbed wire, sometimes drawn on a document. Those that sometimes we spend our whole lives trying to buy...<br />
<br />
But what ways of being in the world were those so different from the European aliens? Forms that we Brazilians know today as the only and correct way to be in the world? Being part of this way of seeing the world, it seems as if these other forms of living on earth have been abandoned... But did the indigenous people really give up their point of view? Did they really allow this story to end likethis? They did not! That's what they taught me and what I came here to tell you...<br />
<br />
[an indigenous music begins to play]<br />
<br />
I think it's time to leave this film based on real facts aside, and turn to look at our region. And I leave a question: who before the invasion inhabited the space we live in today, the valley of Paraíba?<br />
<br />
If Sítio do Picapau Amarelo [a farm in our town about which one of the most famous children’s books writers in Brazil wrote about in his stories. His name was Monteiro Lobato, and ourtown is named after him] takes advantage of the official history, in our researches we found records about some of those who already lived here, the Puri people. Records that we will now share with you.”<br />
<br />
Catarine Dell’Aquila<br />
<br />
"Melissa Ferreira Ramos in her work ‘Re-existence and Indigenous resurgente: Diaspora and Transformations of the Puri People’ tell us:<br />
<br />
‘The Puris have occupied part of the Southeast of Brazil, in the region that goes from the Paraíba Valley that passes through Rio de Janeiro and SãoPaulo, to the area of Rio Pomba, in the Southeast of Minas Gerais.<br />
In the colonization process, sesmarias were created to be sold all over Brazil, making their supposed "owners" open paths in the forests, kill, enslave or negotiate in unjust ways with the Indians who inhabited those lands and made an effort to populate those places. Indigenous lands were diminishing and villages were increasing. The siege around the Indigenous people grew until they were trapped. Contact with the Puris became inevitable, generating many conflicts, deaths and resistance. For the Europeans, the Indigenous people invaded their farms. For the Indigenous people, it was the Luso-Brazilians who invaded their hunting grounds.<br />
<br />
The way of life of the villages was still very different from that of the indigenous people. The Puris had difficulty in accepting this new life... many were dying from diseases and epidemics that they caught through contact with the settlers, others refused to live in this confinement.<br />
<br />
The Brazilian government even created a Puri Village in Queluz, district of Lorena [in the state of São Paulo], in 1801.<br />
<br />
The Puris were not easily convinced to go to the village, but they were being killed and were targets of constant wars, and on top of that, there was now the difficulty to find food from deforestation, caused by colonial politics. In Queluz, they persisted in maintaining their cultural practices and constantly went back to the forests, since according to their culture, they were nomads and did not agree to settle in a single place.<br />
<br />
Those villages were considered extinct by the heirs of the invaders during the 19th century, on the grounds that there were no more Indigenous people there, only caboclos or Indigenous people mixed and already civilized, disregarding those who were refugees, hidden or silenced by society...”<br />
<br />
[the music you listen here is not from the Puris, but from the Guaranis. It was recorded from a choral of children, the Guaranis Mbyá and Nhandeva, who live in the territories we now call São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro].<br />
<br />
Marina Villarinho<br />
<br />
“Aline Rochedo, descendant of the Puri, in the book ‘Boacé Uchô–The history is on the earth’, tells us her version. According to her, the history of the Puri people is a history that is being built. In her words, Aline says:<br />
<br />
"We are listening to the elders of our family and recognizing ourselves, walking the path of our ancestors".<br />
<br />
Among the various stories that Aline collected, we chose that of Ms. Carminha, a Puri woman: "My great grandmother, was caught and taken to a farm down there, in the area of ‘Fumaça’, where she was raped. My grandfather was born white, light-eyed and the son of an "Indian". He was born in the middle of the bamboozal, he did not speak the language of white people. The Puri didnot accept to be enslaved and the whites came and took possession of what was of my ancestors’. The white people arrived and took over. The Puris from ‘Fumaça’ went to the lower mountains and other places in the region. At that time many ‘Indians’ were enslaved. Nobody talked much about this story. And this is very sad. Even in schools, they don't talk about it...”<br />
<br />
To fight this sadness that Dona Carminha feels, Aline decided to put on paper some of the teachings that she learned from her elders. Among these learnings, Aline explains that, for the Puri people, the territory means a place of belonging, of memory, of history. A place where social relations take place, and what I consider most important: where collective bonds of solidarity are generated.”<br />
<br />
Woman 4 (Katia):<br />
<br />
"Yes, I lived somewhere else, I got married very early. And I went to live in the city, and what I missed most there was the people. People’s big tongues! Watching us pass by, taking care of my life! Because it is a people who gossips about our lives, but it is also a people who are very supportive, it is a people who are opened to help at any time. It's what I've missed the most, the human warmth, which there is nowhere else".<br />
<br />
Woman 3 (Cida):<br />
<br />
"The place I liked the most when I was a child was where today is the court, formerly it was a soccer field. There was a ravine where it used to be filled with people sitting and watching the game... there were people from São Benedito, Monteiro, Souzas [different neighborhoods from our town], it wasvery nice, there were people selling ice cream, there was so much going on".<br />
<br />
Simone<br />
<br />
How many houses have you lived in this neighborhood, which was the coolest one and do you own the house you live in today?<br />
<br />
Woman 2 (Ana Serrinha):<br />
<br />
"No, I don't own it, I pay rent, and I have a shack but it's too old and everything is broken and I have no conditions to improve it. And the place I liked the most was João Dias’ [a rented house of a person named João]"<br />
<br />
Woman 6 (Sirleide):<br />
<br />
"The kermesses, the parties we had on the street, where everyone had fun, all this is needed here for the community, because the people here are well connected to the place. So there should be something to distract them, like the street parties, which was very good. I watched a lot, I participated, there's the Festival da Mandioca [The Cassava Party]... there's a lot of things that are needed".<br />
<br />
Narrator -Marcela:<br />
<br />
"You can see that these stories reveal an issue. The occupations of space vary with time and with places that before could and now can no longer be visited. Let's talk about what is sad and obvious: the accesses haven't stopped being interdicted. Behind these memories, the enclosure perseveres. Children no longer play in waterfalls because there are few of those who keep their gates open. Who enters and leaves depend on the permission of those who have possession of the land.<br />
<br />
The same happens in the digital space, in the cyber space, in the internet. You don't pay for each site you enter for example, but you pay a toll so that the data you are exchanging can pass through someone's land. Or someone's cable. Or someone's satellite...<br />
<br />
And this internet that we talk so much about and that is so present in our lives, what do we know about its history? We called Tânia, our ‘digital potato’ to tell us about how the internet was born".<br />
<br />
Tânia Mara:<br />
<br />
"How was the internet born? I was here researching on the internet how the internet was born, that's funny, right? It's like asking a child, 'hey, how were you born?’. The most modern, the one we're used to, the 'www' ,was an invention from the 90s. Yet, it all comes from much earlier. It comes from the 60's. What is this word 'internet'? Net is not from cable TV and Inter does not come from the soccer team [joke referencingto a television company called NET and soccer team called INTER] -it comes from "InterNetworking". ‘Networking’ means 'make connection' in English, and ‘Inter’ is about exchange. In the 60’s there were already computers and they were used for research and so on. And this knowledge was only inside the computer. Suppose you took a picture on your cell phone and your cell phone is not connected to the internet –you won’t be able to get the picture to be anywhere else. For the photo to come out of your cell phone it has to connect to something, be it a wifi, be it a data plan from the operator... And at that time, on the separate computers, to pass anything that was created in one computer to another, they had to use something extra. At that time that something was a very big disk to record. Not like the music discs but... similar!"<br />
<br />
Narrator Marcela:<br />
<br />
“Nowadays, it is really hard to imagine the usefulness of a computer without internet and it seems that its grace is exactly there, but the computer was really more of a machine like other machines, which optimize our daily tasks, and by optimizing it, they end up giving space to new demands that were previously unimaginable. Among this old possibilities of using the computer we can highlight: the ability for it to be programmed to solve huge equations, and, of course, transform a lot of paper into a disk, a diskette, a dial...”<br />
<br />
Tânia Mara:<br />
<br />
"Paul Baran, in the 60's, began to devise ways to build a network that could connect computers, where the information that was in one could be sent to another and vice versa, and we could reproduce the same information in more than one computer, and still do it remotely, that is, from a distance. When you open Facebook, you are not on the Facebook computer, you are not going on their machine itself. From your cell phone or your computer you can get these informations that are on computers far away. Yes, Facebook is inside a computer. Just like Google, Instagram, TikTok, anything else we use on our phone. In the end, much of what we consume is in another computer".<br />
<br />
Narrator –Marcela:<br />
<br />
"So... the cloud doesn't exist! The cloud symbol appeared in the first place because, at the beginning of telephony and computer connections, it was complicated to explain and design the network that connected everything... then, they would design clouds. But.... the cloud doesn’t actually exist. All information depends on physical structures to exist. The Internet is incredible, but it's not magic, and it needs a physical infrastructure not only to be stored and saved, but also to travel, in small packages, through those huge fiber optic cables under the ocean".<br />
<br />
Tânia:<br />
<br />
"Anyway, in the 60's, the research team wanted to be able to exchange all that information... In a physics laboratory in the UK,they researched how to transfer the data from one side to the other -which is called in computer language as a 'package transfer'. We might picture the internet as if it were a big post office. In it, each computer would be a residence, with its own address, which we call 'IP address'. This connection can make these ‘package exchanges’ happen between one computer and another. In other words, in the end, our photo, music, meme, or whatever we consume, in the language of the computer is called 'data' -different from the six-sided dice [joke referencing to the portuguese word, here both dice and data are the same word, ‘dado’] -and this data is sent through the networks in this package transfer".<br />
<br />

"When we talk about data we're talking about 0 and 1, that is, all the photos, all the texts, all the music, all the programs that run on your computer are, in the background, in essence, 0 and 1. Imagine a TV, that looking closely you can see a lot of little squares, very tiny, it's as if eachsquare was 0 or 1. The set of these 0 and 1 in a certain combination, looked from afar, forms an image.<br />
<br />
Let's remember that was a temporary setting, but it reminds us pf the binary world view of the creators of computers. In macro or microcosms, the basis of life of computer and files is the same...”<br />

At that same time in the 1960s, other projects were being developed elsewhere simultaneously, and all those knowledge centers were formulating new ideas and wanted to share them. So they were developing their own intranets..."<br />
<br />
Narrator –Marcela:<br />
<br />
"Speaking of intranet, did you know that PSP is also an intranet? But here, we like to call it a ‘local network’. In other words, if you're connected to one of the wifi points on PSP, you can access our server, a computer, which is located inside the headquarters of the Portal sem Porteiras, filled with information, music, movies, which you can access without having to pay for Claro or Vivo [Brazilian cell phone companies].”<br />

"In France there was theCyclades, in the USA there was the Merit Network, and in the UK, Donald Davies was studying transfers of the packages at the NPL. In 69, in the United States, a project started by ARPA came along. ARPA had a connection with these other networks outside the United States and wanted to do this knowledge exchange. And not only this exchange of knowledge with these other external networks, but also internally. ARPA wanted to have its own network. If any university center, any knowledge center was destroyed, that information would be lost. If they built a network where the information could be shared among the computers that were connected to that network, it would be less of a problem if a university was attacked, if a military center was attacked, because theinformation would be distributed on the other computers of the network. But if the United States had only its own way of transferring packets, it would not be able to connect with those other networks that were happening in other laboratories and knowledge centers around the world. So they accepted and adopted that idea of transferring data as proposed by Mr. Davies' physics lab, they came to an agreement and decided to use a protocol. If each computer spoke its language, they would not be able to communicate. Then, there would be no Internet, they would not be able to exchange information. It's like us, humans, for example. Me speaking Portuguese, here now. Another person speaking Spanish. Another person speaking Mandarin. Another person speaking English.All together, we won’t understand each other very well. We may understand each other through a sign, an agreement... but this has to be established, there has to be some kind of protocol. Something like putting your hand near your mouth is a sign of hunger. Regardless of the language, it is agreed that this symbol means hunger.<br />
<br />
In the case of the computer, these protocols were defined, which made it possible to do this exchange of information between one computer and another. And then in 74, besides accepting the transfer of packages, they also entered into an agreement on how to define the computer's name, direction, and address. In the same way that the post office needs a zip code to be able to send a correspondence to a residence, each computer has itsidentification on the network, the IP address.<br />
<br />
So in 74, these two big agreements were signed -the IP address and the DNS. Today, for example, when we access a Google search, we don't have to write down the IP address. If you type 'Google.com', your computer can already find this information on the network. And this is what we call a domain. Facebook.com' is another domain. If you search the internet now for the Facebook IP address, a numerical sequence will appear. If you type this number in your browser, the Facebook page will appear. That is, your computer and cell phone can access a web page through these two types of address, either through the name or through the IP address".<br />
<br />
Narrator –Marcela:<br />
<br />
"In short, what makes the existence of the Internet possible are the protocols, that is, an agreement to use a common language between computers, IP, a number so that each computer can receive and send information, and DNS, another protocol that makes it possible to transform those numbers -which is how the computer thinks and communicates -into unique names intelligible to humans, not machines".<br />

"In the 1980’s, this network, this infrastructure that had a boom in the United States, ended up being used primarily by universities and government institutions. Some private institutions had access to it, but it was not opened to civilians, to anyone who wanted to have their virtual store... ordinary people did not have access to the internet. In 1995, the NSF project, which was this network of universities, ended and opened the gateway for commercial use. In other words, 95 was when the boom of the internet started. Before, in 1990, Berners-Lee invented the ‘WWW’, which facilitated access to addresses -‘World Wide Web’, that is what ‘WWW’ means, and it would be a unique name to be used worldwide. So, at that time, it was defined that one page would have the same name anywhere in the whole world. It was also at this time that the links were created. That blue line that if you click, it takes you to another page.<br />
<br />
The link brought an easier way of navigating between pages, to find a page worldwide. The opening for commercial use brought a boom to the internet. Besides, in the 90's, they managed to make a list of what was on the internet. Imagine, until then, one didn't know what was on the internet, there wasn’t a Google or something. Google works exactly like this. If your room is a mess, you still have some idea where things are. So you have a mental index of where to find something, no matter how chaotic it is, you need a comb, go there and find it.<br />
<br />
In the case of the internet, there wasn’t a person in that position. Only who created a webpage knew where it was. And at that time, the tools that listed the contents that were available on the internet started to appear, and Google for example was born in 1998. So, it is still very young. Google ended up gaining so many users because they created a new way to make this listing. When you have an index of a book, for example, usually the chapters are ordered by pages there. Chapter one, chapter two... there is a linear order, and this sequence follows the sequence of the pages. In the case of the Internet, we do not have a page number. So to decide that one page should appear before the other? Then Google came up with ‘relevance’ That is, every web page that appears in the results has some relevance, there are reasons for it to appear first.”<br />
<br />
Narrator –Marcela:<br />
<br />
“Hey, but wait a minute! That is where the danger really lies. Ok, so Google did a favor in organizing information from around the world, which you can put in a search engine and receive a lot of answers, organized by relevance. But... relevance for whom?<br />
<br />
Despite the algorithmic efforts to make us human beings easily understandable by machines, the human cultural multiplicity is much greater than what machines can embrace, and if relevance is important, to leave in the hands of an artificial intelligence to decide what matters to us, is to reduce us to a cultural uniqueness and hierarchy as effective and destructive as were the European colonization. And for artificial intelligence, it is even easier to understand us when we become more and more equal.”<br />
<br />
Tânia:<br />
<br />
"At Google, the first links are probably sponsored -the webpage paid Google to appearat the top. And the following ones come up because they use criteria within their websites that ends up making them listed at the beginning of the search. If you want to, you can search on the internet how to make your page appear first in Google results.In a way this impacts the businesses, because people will not look at the end of the search page for information, there are few people who do this. And I even recommend doing it, because you can access much more content than the first one that is being offered. If you limit yourself to only the first content that is being offered, you have a restriction of information you can get.<br />
<br />
In the 90's a certain occupation of this cyberspace also happened. That territory was beginning to open up to the people who were not in the governmental sphere. At that time, there were few websites, and there weren't any apps, there wasn't a cell phone that connected to the internet. That was only in 1996, and back then, there were no packages of whats app for free, it was all very expensive and slow... It was in 2001 e-mails on cell phones started existing, and only by 2008 that actually popularized and people started being more connected through their phones than through computers.<br />
<br />
Anyway... in the mid 90's, the content that was on the internet was produced by people. The web pages, or a virtual gallery, was created by someone who had an interest in something. Nowadays, that logic has already been reversed. Whoever is surfing the internet ended up becoming only a consumer of content. All right, we upload photos, texts, videos of Youtube, music on SoundClod, there is content production. But any content you put on these platforms does not belong to you. It belongs to the platform. If Facebook decides to disappear from the earth, all your photos will disappear along with it! If you don't have a copy somewhere... even for Youtube, all this content that people produce and put on Youtube is Youtube's copyright in the end. If Youtube ended today, all the content on it ends as well. In other words, we left the role of creators of a Cyber space to become Cyber space consumers. The internet ended up becoming a great shopping mall where people enter, walk around, look to the sides, take a selfie... and go on. Different from before, where people had to create that space to circulate in. But, I guess the subject on the occupation of this space is a conversation for another time..."<br />
<br />
Narrator –Marcela:<br />
<br />
"While we celebrate the possibility of more andmore people moving through this virtual space, having more access to information, getting to know more people, it is also like dancing carnival on a guarded street, taking drugs with predictable effects, and wearing costumes chosen by other people. It's as if all movements were induced and then monitored, but we still celebrate something.<br />
<br />
The Internet is a two-way street, which allows us some freedom and some imprisonment. This is all because the infrastructure is commanded by corporations, those who own the roads, in search of profit. But that doesn't mean that we can't use it in other ways, taking advantage of technological advances in another way, not using unnecessary advances, turning outdated routers into a luxury that is only ours. And it's because we believe that the Internet has wasted its potential to serve the great monster of capital that the Portal without Porteiras exists.<br />

We’ll keep on trans-existing. I’ll see you on our next episode!"<br />
