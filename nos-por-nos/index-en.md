Nodes that Bond sprouts from the need to occupy the virtual territory with feminist narratives.

We felt the lack of a safe space for shared learning and found it very difficult to get more women to participate in the implementation of a community network in the neighborhood.

As machines and technique are domains historically occupied by the male presence, we as women felt the urgency to open our own trails to the source of these knowledges. During circular meetings allied to basic technology tutorials we began to weave collective knowledge through the creation of common ground.

Knowledge is never generic, it only ever exists applied to territory and context. This understanding is very important to help us generate and manage our autonomous network in the best way. Beyond the virtual connection, we seek to keep women connected to each other, learn more about the territory we inhabit and manifest technology as a practice.
